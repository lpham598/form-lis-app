## Description

This repository contains a simple form web application with a front end built using Vite and React, and a back end built with Flask. Both the front end and back end are contained within the same repository, with the front end located in the `client` directory and the back end in the `server` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running the front end)
- Python 3 (for running the back end)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- pip (Python Package Installer)

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vite-React-Flask.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Vite-React-Flask/client
   ```

3. **Install Front End Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Front End Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open Another Terminal Window:**

6. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   ```

7. **Install Back End Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. **Run the Back End Server:**
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   On Windows:
